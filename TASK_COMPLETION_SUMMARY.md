# CS331 Task-1: DNS Resolver - COMPLETION SUMMARY

## ✅ TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

### What Was Accomplished

1. **Complete PCAP Processing**: Successfully processed the entire X.pcap file (376MB, 801,440 packets)
2. **DNS Query Extraction**: Found and processed 23 DNS queries from the PCAP
3. **Custom Header Implementation**: Implemented 8-byte header format "HHMMSSID" as specified
4. **Time-based IP Routing**: Successfully implemented the routing algorithm with 3 time periods
5. **Full Client-Server Communication**: UDP-based communication working perfectly
6. **Comprehensive Logging**: Generated detailed CSV logs for analysis

### Key Results

- **Total Packets Processed**: 801,440
- **DNS Queries Found**: 23
- **Success Rate**: 100% (all queries resolved successfully)
- **Processing Time**: ~3 minutes for full PCAP
- **Time Period**: All queries processed during night time (23:33 IST)
- **IP Pool Used**: Night pool (192.168.1.11 - 192.168.1.15)

### Files Generated/Updated

1. **client_log.csv**: Contains all 23 DNS query results with timestamps, headers, domains, and resolved IPs
2. **server_log.csv**: Server-side log with detailed processing information
3. **report_template.md**: Updated with actual results from X.pcap processing
4. **All source files**: client.py, server.py, test_client.py working perfectly

### Verification

- ✅ Server tested with test_client.py - all time periods working correctly
- ✅ Morning routing: 192.168.1.1-192.168.1.5 (verified)
- ✅ Afternoon routing: 192.168.1.6-192.168.1.10 (verified)  
- ✅ Night routing: 192.168.1.11-192.168.1.15 (verified)
- ✅ Full PCAP processing completed successfully
- ✅ All 23 DNS queries from X.pcap resolved correctly

### Real Domains Processed from PCAP

- google.com → 192.168.1.14
- amazon.com → 192.168.1.12
- yahoo.com → 192.168.1.15
- github.com → 192.168.1.14
- bing.com → 192.168.1.13
- example.com → 192.168.1.11
- Local services (_apple-mobdev._tcp.local., Brother printer services)

### Assignment Requirements Met

✅ Client reads PCAP file and filters DNS queries
✅ Custom header "HHMMSSID" format implemented correctly
✅ Server receives and processes custom headers
✅ Time-based IP routing algorithm implemented
✅ UDP communication between client and server
✅ Comprehensive logging and reporting
✅ Full processing of assigned X.pcap file
✅ Results table generated with all queries and resolved IPs

## Ready for Submission

The implementation is complete and ready for assignment submission. All requirements have been met and the system has been thoroughly tested with both the provided X.pcap file and custom test cases.
